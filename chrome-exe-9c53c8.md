Errors related to chrome.exe can arise due to various issues, including corrupt installations, conflicting software, or insufficient system resources, leading to crashes or performance degradation. To ensure safety, users should always download Chromium from official sources and keep their antivirus software updated to detect any malicious files masquerading as chrome.exe.
